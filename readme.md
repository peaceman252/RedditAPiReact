React app made using the reddit api.
The app is split into a varity of pages by using react router.
The home page is mostly blank to start with only a header and a navbar. 
The user can type in a subreddit into the search bar and when they hit submit the posts of that subreddit will appear.
The reset button removes these posts.
The other links in the navbar go straight to their respective subreddit.

The app is ran by using npm start in the command line.
Was able to deploy app to firebase but console shows errors about the project complaining about http/https. 
Won't fetch any data.
